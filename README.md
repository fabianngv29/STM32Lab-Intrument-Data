# STM32Lab-Intrument-Data
This repository contains the complete dataset used in the educational evaluation of the STM32Lab, an integrated microcontroller learning platform designed to improve hands-on laboratory performance in microcontroller course.
The study follows a **quasi-experimental design** comparing:

- **Control Group** → Blue Pill and breadbords (traditional)
- **Experimental Group** → STM32Lab (integrated PCB)

The dataset enables complete reproducibility of the statistical and qualitative analyses of the study.

# Data
### **1. Pre and Post Learning Surveys (Pre.csv, Post.csv)**
These files contain responses to 17 Likert-scale items (Q1–Q17) and three open-response items (Q18–Q20).  
The survey measures student perceptions of competencies such as:

- Microcontroller fundamentals  
- Programming in C and Assembly  
- Debugging and troubleshooting  
- Peripheral configuration (GPIO, ADC, PWM, UART, I²C)  
- Datasheet interpretation  
- Autonomous learning  
- Readiness for interdisciplinary embedded-systems projects  

**Columns:**

- `Group` → 1 = Control, 2 = Experimental  
- `q1`–`q17` → Likert responses (1–5)  
- `q18`, `q19`, `q20` → open-ended answers  

**Uses:**  
Pre/post analysis, item-level gain computation, global improvement evaluation, qualitative coding.

### **2. Laboratory Logs (Logs.xlsx)**

This file contains **10 sheets**, each corresponding to one laboratory practice.  
Logs include real-world performance metrics captured during hands-on sessions.

**Columns:**

- `Group` (1 = Control, 2 = Experimental)  
- `Time (min)`  
- `Observed participation`  
- `Common difficulties`  
- Error categories:
  - `Errors: Hardware/Connection`
  - `Errors: Prototype/Assembly`
  - `Errors: Firmware/Configuration`
  - `Errors: Conceptual/Logical`
- `Total Errors`
- `Practice notes`

**Uses:**  
Time-on-task analysis, error distribution per group, difficulty profiling, comparative performance evaluation.

### **3. MSLQ-SF Survey (MSLQ.csv)**

Results from a subset of the **Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire Short Form (MSLQ-SF)**,  
which assesses motivational and self-regulated learning behaviors.

Includes Likert 1–5 items evaluating:

- Task Value (TV)
- Effort Regulation (ESR)
- Anxiety (ANX)
- Elaboration (ELB)
- Organization (ORG)
- Intrinsic Goal Orientation (IGO)
- Metacognitive & Behavioral Self-Regulation (MCR)
- Time & Resource Management (TRM)

**Uses:**  
Correlation with learning gains, motivational profiling, regression models, multi-dimensional learning analysis.
